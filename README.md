# Scrape naukri.com using Scrapy

# Requirements

1. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/)
3. [Scrapyd](https://scrapyd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

Scrapy is powerful framework for extracting data from websites. In this project, i have tried to use some of its feature to extract data from [Naukri](www.naukri.com) and save it in a folder.

To scrape any website one needs to understand the [DOM](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_htmldom.asp) and [xpath](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_intro.asp). Xpath is easy to understand, you can practice it online on [Xpather](http://xpather.com/).
